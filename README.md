### Elasti Harp

A little script to test out loading a \_data.json file from harp into 
elasticsearch. Once the basic concept is done, I'll try out iterating 
over the directory of a harp project itself and automatically deciding 
on indexs based on folder name and stuff perhaps. 

Or I'll just keep it as a json loader for flat objects into ES.
